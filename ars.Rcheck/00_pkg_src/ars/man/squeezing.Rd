\title{Squeezing function}
\usage{
squeezing(h,x)
}
\arguments{
\item{h}{The log of the density function}

\item{x}{The nodes, found by abscissae()}
}
\description{
Calculates the lower hull of h. The returned value is a matrix with each row storing (slope, h(x_i),x_i) for each node. In this way, each lower hull is uniquely defined. Note that the number of squeezing lines is that of the envelop lines plus one.
