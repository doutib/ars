\title{Adaptive rejection sampler
The main ars() function}
\usage{
ars(h, n, domain, x1 = NULL, xk = NULL, x0 = 0, nmesh = 5,
  x_start = 0, max_x = 10000, min_step = 0.01, relax_factor = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{h}{The log of the density function}

\item{n}{The number of points to be sampled}

\item{domain}{A vector of length 2 giving the domain (left bound, right bound) of the density function}

\item{x1}{The leftmost node of the abscissae, if not provided, the abscissae() will try to find one which has a suitable slope, leading to a unbiased and numerical-issues friendly sampling process}

\item{xk}{The the rightmost node of the abscissae, if not provided, the abscissae() will try to find one which has a suitable slope, leading to a unbiased and numerical-issues friendly sampling process}

\item{x0}{An initial point for searching for suitable x1 and xk. If provided by the user based on the knowledge of the density function, then it would be faster to find x1 and xk. default = 0}

\item{nmesh}{The number of nodes in the initial grid. default = 5}

\item{x_start}{If x1 and xk are not provided, ars will call search() to adaptively search for an appropriate starting point to pass to abscissae() as x0. default = 0}

\item{max_x}{The maximum search limit for x. default is set to 10000. If the mode is shifted beyond this limit, the user should define this parameter.}

\item{min_step}{The minimum size of steps to take while searching for appropriate x1 to xk. default = .01}

\item{relax_factor}{The relaxation factor in the adaptive-step search algorithm. default = 10}
}
\value{
A vector with n sampled points from density of interest.
