\title{Log concavity test}
\usage{
log_concavity(u,l)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{the upper hull calculated using envelop(h,x,domain)}

\item{l}{the lower hull calculated using squeezing(h,x)}
}
\description{
Checks that at each node, the upper hull and lower hull would bound the h function. The slope of the envelop lines and squeezing lines are examined.
